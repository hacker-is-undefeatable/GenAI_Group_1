Workflow

Data Collection: Collect and label a dataset with texts related to biology and viruses.


Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data.


Feature Extraction: Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.


Model Training: Train a classifier like SVM or a neural network on the processed data.


Evaluation: Validate the model and tune hyperparameters.


Deployment: Deploy the model for real-time classification of user inputs.
